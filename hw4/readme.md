# Assignment 4 (Extra Credit)

In this assignment, we explore clustering methods.

The functions written for this purpose are in the pipeline_clust.py file.

In the notebook Assignment 4 - Clustering (Extra Credit).ipynb, we demonstrate these functions by applying them to the analysis of DonorsChoose data.

Assignment 4 Report.pdf is the descriptive report from this analysis.
